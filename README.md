# PyTEAP

*PyTEAP* is an implementation of [Toolbox for Emotion Analysis using Physiological signals (TEAP)](https://github.com/Gijom/TEAP) in Python.

This project intends to make TEAP originally written in MATLAB more usable by porting it into Python, so that it can interoperate with other packages written in Python.
